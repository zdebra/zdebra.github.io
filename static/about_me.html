          <h5>Launching Integration with Uber</h5>
          <p>
            I built a technical solution to integrate Omio's ticketing system
            into the Uber app, which was successfully launched. I was
            responsible for ensuring that the system met agreed-upon
            availability and response time SLAs. To this day, I am leading a
            team responsible for maintaining and supporting this system.

            architecture of all of Omio's systems. I worked as the leader and
            owner of the Golang language stack. I had to write and review many

            brand-new products. I learned how to navigate in a company focused
            on B2C and adapt systems to support B2B use cases.
